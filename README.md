# Microphone (Files coming soon)

This is my iteration of the open hardware project from DIYPERKS which you can find here:

The schematic is the same only drawn in Fusion/Eagle.

I also designed a single layer pcb to be able to etch the board and make it a smaller package in general.

I designed my own arm, which can be 3d printed. It's supposed to be mounted to a desk and holds all the electronics within the hull of the headphone holder.

As for cables up to the microphone, I simply used an ethernet cable because this provides ample shielding while being easy to work with.

The shielding inside the hull is a brass mesh which I bought off of Amazon and connected to gnd.
